# Advent of Code 2019 in Haskell

I saw [this Scala meet-up](http://www.lsug.co.uk/workshop/kata/scala/functional/typelevel/2020/03/06/workshop-coding-with-cats.html) where they were going to tackle the first 3 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges using FP in Scala, and thought it would be a good exercise to try it in Haskell.

## Running it

Requires `stack`. Do this:

```
> stack build && stack exec advent-of-code-exe
# lots of stack output ...
Day 1 part 1: 3471229
Day 1 part 2: 5203967
Day 2 part 1: 3306701
Day 2 part 2: 7621
```
