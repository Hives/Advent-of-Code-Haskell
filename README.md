# Advent of Code 2019

In Haskell. I saw this Scala meet-up where they were going to tackle the first
3 Advent of Code challenges using FP in Scala, and thought it would be a good
exercise to try it in Haskell:

## Running it

Requires `stack`. Do this:

```
> stack build && stack exec advent-of-code-exe
```
